          <p> My name is Ayah Dineh and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College. </p>
          <p> Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience
            with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma,
            and
            Sketch.</p>

          <p> I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to
            experiment
            with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>

            <h4>Logo Creation</h4>
            <p>Your logo is the face of your brand and the first thing that potential customers will see, so it's
              crucial
              to
              make a
              great first impression. I can help create a logo that is both visually stunning and effective in
              representing
              your
              brand.</p>

            <h4>Web Design</h4>
            <p>Your website is often the first interaction customers have with your business, so it's important to make
              a
              strong
              first impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks great but also functions flawlessly
              and
              engages your target audience.</p>

            <h4>Full Branding</h4>
            <p>Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the overall image that your business presents
              to the world, including the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a cohesive and
              impactful brand that resonates with your target audience and sets you apart from your competitors.</p>
